Jembi Health Systems NPC is an Africa based non-profit company, registered in accordance with the company laws of South Africa, that develops and curates open source software and health information systems. We manage open source software Products; core areas of expertise include requirements gathering and management, technical system design and solution architecture, software development and quality control, implementation and capacity building, and monitoring and evaluation.

As an organisation Jembi Health Systems NPC is passionate about its open source Products and the developer and user communities that grow around them. As a member of one of these communities Jembi Health Systems NPC needs to have an agreement with You regarding your Contributions to the Product code and/or documentation that we curate.

Before Contributing to the Product Jembi Health Systems NPC requests you to please sign this Contributor License Agreement (CLA). CLAs are a commonly accepted practice for open source software projects. They are used to facilitate the broad use and distributions of the Product while retaining users’ confidence in the origins and ongoing existence of the Product code. This CLA gives Jembi Health Systems NPC permission to distribute your contributed code without restriction. It does not assign to us any copyright and the ownership of the intellectual property rights remains with you. It merely ensures that the Product remains open source. You cannot withdraw permission for its use at a later date.

Once signed this CLA between Jembi Health Systems NPC and You will be kept on file by Jembi Health Systems NPC as the legal curators of the intellectual property and copyright of the Product.
